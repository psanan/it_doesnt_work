\begin{center}
The code has stopped working with no explanation. \\
It doesn't make sense and you cry in frustration.\\
Just take a deep breath and use these three suggestions, \\
so you will be able to ask the right questions.\\
\end{center}

\section*{Ask yourself:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\emph{Why} do you need it to work?}\\
What is the context for your problem? What is the larger goal?

\item \textbf{How do you \emph{show} that it doesn't work?}\\
What are the steps for someone else to reproduce your problem?
How will you know that the problem is resolved?

\item \textbf{What \emph{does} work?}\\
How far are you from a working state? What similar cases work?
\end{itemize}

\vspace{10pt}

\section*{Trouble Answering?}
Reconsider your work flow. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Work on one thing at a time. 
\item Document your progress. 
\item Test often. 
\item Visualize often. 
\item Save working states often. 
\item Plan for reproducibility. 
\item Make your code visible and useful to others. 
\end{itemize}
Version control (e.g. \texttt{git}) is often useful.
